MyLinkedList
============

## My implementation of a linked list data structure

I was revisiting my data structures and algorithms for an 
interview and decided why not put it on github while I was at it!
Note: this is a singly linked list. 

I inlcuded in the comments mytime complexity analyses, 
and was surprised at how many operations
could be done in O(1) time, though some methods see improvement from
use of pointer nodes (like tail) as their brute force implementations
yielded O(n).

The linked list is such a versatile data structure, really one of the key
building blocks for some of the more advanced ones.

Included in this custom java package is also the tests I ran to validate
my linked list methods "LinkedListTester."
